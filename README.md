My simplistic personal domain that directs visitors to everything related to my work and personal projects.

## Overview
From this site, visitors can find links to my social media accounts, Github, and personal project blog. 
Additonally, various methods of contacting me are available, as well as a short bio describing who I am and what I'm about.

## Setup
